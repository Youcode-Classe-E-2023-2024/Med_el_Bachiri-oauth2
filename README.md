# Centralized OAuth2 Authentication System with Laravel API

This project aims to develop a centralized OAuth2 authentication system for third-party applications using Laravel API. It includes features such as creating a default administrator via a seeder, user management by the administrator (creation, modification, deletion), user authentication and obtaining an access token for data access, group and permission creation, unit testing with PHPUnit, and API documentation with Swagger.

## Project Overview:

### 1. Default Administrator Creation via Seeder:

To kickstart the system, a seeder will be utilized to create a default administrator with predefined information.

### 2. User Management by Administrator:

The administrator should have the ability to create, modify, and delete users. This includes managing basic information such as name, email, and password.

### 3. User Authentication and Access Token Retrieval:

Users should be able to authenticate with their credentials and receive an access token enabling them to access protected data of third-party applications.

### 4. Group and Permission Creation:

Users will be organized into groups, and specific permissions will be assigned to each group. This will allow fine-grained control over access to application resources and functionalities.

### 5. Unit Testing with PHPUnit:

Unit tests will be written for each component of the system to ensure its reliability and stability. PHPUnit will be used as the testing tool.

### 6. Documentation with Swagger:

API documentation will be automatically generated using Swagger. This will enable third-party developers to easily explore available endpoints and understand how to use them.

## How to Use:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Youcode-Classe-E-2023-2024/Med_el_Bachiri-oauth2.git
```


2. **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
   composer install
```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your environment variables, including database connection details and OAuth2 settings.

4. **Run Migrations**:
```
   php artisan migrate
```

5. **Install Passport and Generate Keys**:
```
   php artisan passport:install
```

6. **Seed Default Administrator**:
```
   php artisan db:seed
```

8. **Generate Swagger Documentation**:
```
   php artisan l5-swagger:generate
```

8. **Start the Server**:
```
   php artisan serve
```


9. **Explore API Documentation**:
- Visit `/api/documentation` endpoint to explore API documentation generated by Swagger.

## Testing Methods:

#### To test methods in the application, follow these steps:
1. **Run PHPUnit Tests:**
```
    php artisan test
```
- This command will run all PHPUnit tests in the tests directory.

2. **Test Specific Methods:**

- If you want to test specific methods, you can use PHPUnit's --filter option. For example, to test the method test_getting_user_details in the UserTest class, you can use:

```
    php artisan test --filter=UserTest::test_getting_user_details
```
